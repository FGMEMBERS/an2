<strong>Introduction<div align="center"></div></strong>
   
<p>    This is model of legendary Russian AN-2. First fly was 1947 and some aircrafts in use up to nowadays.</p><p>
     Original model for MS Flight Simulator was written 2005 by Anton Nikolaev. His model become bestseller of russian simmers community. This model for FlightGear published under GPL with author permission.</p>
<p>     This version 0.2 of model. It's have 3D cockpit and many improvements of systems, animations etc. Photo of real AN-2 you can see<A href="an2_original_panel.html"> here.</A></p>
   
 <p>   Model for FlightGear use 3D data, converted from MSFS by original technics. Textures and sounds has take "as is", without proceed. Port to FGFS, 2D panel, 3D cockpit, original instruments, FDM, systems and over made by Yurik V. Nikiforoff, may 2006 - apr 2007.</p>
   <p> There are 8 livreas for model.</p>

    <p><strong>Engine start procedure</strong></p>
    <p>Before start, turn on main battery switch (pos. 48), set magneto selector (23) to (1+2) position, set fuel tank selector (9) to up position, and turn throttle to idle.For start engine, turn on starter switch (24), spin inertial starter by turn starter selector (25) to left position,hold until spinup - see to ampermeter (17), listen sound of gyro. After spinup, turn starter selector to right and hold until engine started. Turn off starter switch (24).</p>
    <strong>Radio and navigation procedure<br><br></strong>
     <p>Turn on generator (47). Turn on PO-500 alternator (64). Turn on all switches pos.29, 49-60 , except panel lighting (56). Turn on radio altimeter and set warning to desired altitude (8). </p>
<p>    Tune ADF radio by settings digit of frequency, work and stand-by channel (pos. 73, 74). There are hotspots under and above digit wheels. Select desired channel by switch pos. 63. Green lamp (71,72) will be indicate work channel. Turn switch 69 and listen Morze code of ADF beacon, set volume by handle 70.
</p><p>    Adjust gyroinductional compass to mag meridian by press button 26 until GIK heading indicator (pos.2) has stop rotation. Set index (white needle) to desired heading (heading of runway or route) by press button in the left bottom corner of GIK instruments.</p>
     <p>Adjust gyrocompass GPK (pos.3) by operate his button. For adjust, GPK should be in caged state (see red label under digit ribbon). Press to center of GPK button for select cage. After red label will appear, adjust heading of GPK by press to left and right border of GPK button. When heading stay right, click to center of button for un-cage instrument.</p>
    <p>Cause GPK has not longitudal correction, it's not intended for long route. GPK should be used for short time and distance - pattern, approach etc, like real aircraft.</p>
    <p>Un-cage attitude indicator AGK pos.1 by click on his right button. Caged flag will disappear, and needles of instrument stay in work position. You can adjust horizont level by click to left button of AGK, but only when instrument stay in cage state, like GPK.</p>
    <strong> <br>Flight procedure</strong>
    <p>
    For right control of engine, you should operate not only throttle. Propeller pitch - is very important parameter too. Please, configure you joystick or keyboard for operate propeller pitch. You can operate of pitch handle by press mouse to hotspot, but it's very inconveniently.
</p>
    <p>For take-off, pitch handle (pos. 62) must be in front position, and manifold pressure (pos. 15) should be 900-1000 mm.Hg. Time for max power (1000 mmHg, 2200 rpm) - up to 5 min. </p>
	<p>For right engine control, operate manifold pressure by throttle handle, and rpm - by pitch handle. Model has pitch automatic control subsystem, so it's work like real aircraft... I hope:)</p>
	<p>Optimal climbing speed - 140 km/h. For right flight control digit, please read Flight Manual. I can't put it into model pack, but there is nice web version <A href="http://www.agplane.nl/manuals/antonovan2/index.html"> here.</A>
</p>
<strong>Performance issue</strong>
<p>For best FPS, not use UV-lighting (pos. 56), if you have not enough power of video system. Use experimental lighting (pos. 78, 79) instead.</p><p>If you have power video board, you can set up high resolution of 3d cockpit textures. Set /an2/textures/low-res to "false" by edit an2-set.xml file. </p>
<strong>2D panel issue</strong>
<p>There is clipping error for some 2D instruments for version 0.9.10. For avoid ugly appearance, I comment GPK for 2D panel. If you use devel version of FlightGear, you may uncomment it (strings 491-498 in Panels/ruspanel.xml) and GPK will stay on his place.
