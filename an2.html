<strong>Introduction<div align="center"></div></strong>
<p>This is model of legendary Russian Antonov AN-2. First flight was 1947 and some aircrafts in use up to nowadays.<br>
     Original model for MS Flight Simulator was written 2005 by Anton Nikolaev. His model become bestseller of russian simmers community. This model for FlightGear published under GPL with author permission.
    <br>
Model for FGSF use 3D data, converted from MSFS by original technics, and textures and sounds, take "as is", without proceed. Port to FGFS, 2D panel, FDM, systems and over made by Yurik V. Nikiforoff, may - nov 2006.<br>
There are 8 livreas for model. Model have not animated 3D cabin, there is 2D panel only.<br></p>
You <strong>must</strong> use devel version of FlightGear with model. You can download precompiled Win32 devel version of FlightGear from <A href="ftp://ftp.megasignal.com/pub/FlightGear/devel" name="here" id="ftp.megasignal.com/pub/devel"  onclick="ftp.megasignal.com/pub/devel">ftp.megasignal.com/pub/devel</A>

<strong><div align="center">Starter procedure</div></strong>

<p>Real AN-2 equipped inertial starter. It allow to start engine even main 
battery full discharged - there is handle for spinup flywheel of starter 
manually, from cargo cabin. Usually, for start engine, flywheel of starter 
spinned of electric engine.</p><p>Main procedure of use inertial starter this:</p><p>1. Turn on electrical circuit for supply electrical engine of starter: main battery switch and starter switch. Red "generator failure" lamp will on, like a 
car; turn on fuel selector.</p><p>2. Spinup of flywheel of starter; for this, turn starter selector to left 
position and hold it _until flywheel will spinned_. While wheel spinning, 
consumable current will decreasing from max value (see VA-3 instrument) to 
value around zero, when flywheel will spin enough. šIt take around 7 sec; you 
will hear sound of spinned flywheel.</p><p>3. Apply spinned flywheel to engine crankshaft: set starter selector to right 
position and hold it _until engine started_. It take several second; see on 
tachometer instrument TE-48. When engine achieved above 550 rpm, release 
selector and turn off starter switch.</p><p>There is one problem around it. Power of starter not enough for spin engine 
shaft with big propeller - as I understand, this is JSBsim limitation. I read 
about it in devel list, but fix not ready yet. Cause this limitation, 
inertial starter may work unstable.</p><p>You may discard inertial started at all - go to an2-set.xml and comment 
binding of key 32 (spacebar). It allow you crank engine by press spacebar, as default.</p>
